<h1>Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative</h1>
<h1>2025 Campaign</h1>

<p>Since 2004, <a href="https://oaei.ontologymatching.org">OAEI</a> organises evaluation campaigns aiming at evaluating ontology matching technologies.
This year we are adopting the <a href="melt/index.html">MELT platform</a> for the evaluation. The use of MELT facilitates 
the participation of non Java systems and, at the same time, it provides compatibility with systems wrapped according to the SEALS specification.
The Interactive, SPIMBENCH and Link discovery tracks are exceptions and the only tracks relying on the SEALS client and the HOBBIT platform, respectively.
For systems participating in tracks using the <a href="https://hobbit-project.github.io/OAEI_2025.html">HOBBIT</a> platform (SPIMBENCH and Link discovery) and the Interactive track (SEALS), 
MELT also facilitates the system wrapping.
</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>The OAEI 2025 campaign will once again confront ontology matchers to ontology and data sources to be matched.
This year, the following test sets are available:

<dl compact="1">

<h3>T-Box/Schema matching</h3>

<dt><a href="anatomy/index.html">anatomy</a> </dt><dd>The <b>anatomy</b>
  real world case is about matching the Adult Mouse Anatomy (2744 classes) and the NCI Thesaurus (3304 classes) describing the human anatomy.</dd>

<dt><a href="conference/index.html">conference</a> </dt>
<dd>
The goal of the track is to find alignments within a collection of ontologies describing the domain of organising conferences. Additionally, 'complex correspondences' are also very welcome. Alignments will be evaluated automatically against reference alignments also considering its uncertain version presented at ISWC 2014. Summary results along with detail performance results for each ontology pair (test case) and comparison with tools' performance from last years will be provided.</dd>

<dt><a href="multifarm/index.html">Multifarm</a> </dt>
<dd>
This dataset is composed of a subset of the Conference dataset, translated in nine different languages (Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Portuguese,  Russian, and Spanish) and the corresponding alignments between these ontologies. Based on these test cases, it is possible to evaluate and compare the performance of matching approaches with a special focus on multilingualism. 
</dd>

<dt><a href="complex/index.html">Complex</a> </dt>
<dd>
This track evaluates the detection of complex correspondences between ontologies of the conference domain. <!-- hydrography, geography and species taxonomy. Each dataset has its particularities and evaluation modalities.-->
</dd>

<dt><a href="food/index.html">Food Nutritional Composition</a></dt>
<dd>
This track consists of finding alignments between food concepts from CIQUAL, the French food nutritional composition database, and food concepts from SIREN. Food concepts from both databases are described in LanguaL, a well-known multilingual thesaurus using faceted classification. 
</dd>
 
<dt><a href="interactive/index.html">Interactive matching evaluation</a>
  (interactive) <img width="30" border="0" src="../seals-logo.jpg"/></dt>
<dd>
This track offers the possibility to compare different interactive matching tools which require user interaction. 
The goal is to show if user interaction can improve the matching results, which methods are most promising and how many 
interactions are necessary. All participating systems are evaluated using an oracle which bases on the reference alignment. 
Using the SEALS client, the matching system only needs to be slightly adapted to participate to this track.
</dd>

<dt><a href="https://krr-oxford.github.io/OAEI-Bio-ML/">Bio-ML</a></dt>
<dd>
The <b>Bio-ML</b> track is a Machine Learning (ML) friendly Biomedical track for Equivalence and Subsumption Matching. 
This track presents an unified evaluation framework suitable for both ML-based and non-ML-based OM systems. 
The datasets of this track are based on Mondo and UMLS Metathesarus. This track 
supersedes the previous <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/projects/SEALS/oaei/">largebio</a> and 
<a href="http://sws.ifi.uio.no/oaei/phenotype/">phenotype</a> tracks.
</dd>

<dt><a href="biodiv/index.html">Biodiversity and Ecology</a> (biodiv) </dt>
<dd>
  The goal of the track is to find pairwise alignments between ontologies and thesauri that are particularly useful for biodiversity and ecology research and are being used in various projects. They have been developed in parallel and are very overlapping. They are semantically rich and contain tens of thousands of classes.
</dd>

<!--
<dt><a href="https://github.com/EngyNasr/MSE-Benchmark">Material Sciences and Engineering</a> (mse) </dt>
<dd>
   The Material Sciences and Engineering (MSE) track contains the first benchmark for the evaluation of (semi-)automatic 
   ontology matching techniques. In this emerging ontological domain, small to mid-sized upper and domain level ontologies 
   are used that contain concepts described in natural language and are implemented by heterogeneous design principles 
   with only partial overlap to each other. 
   The current version of the MSE Track (v.1.0) includes three test cases, each consists of two MSE ontologies and a 
   manual reference alignment that can be used for the evaluation.
  </dd>

-->

<dt><a href="digitalhumanities/index.html">Digital Humanities</a>  (dh)</dt>
<dd>The goal of the Digital Humanities track is to evaluate matching system performance when dealing with small datasets in different languages and specialist terms from archaeology, cultural history and the interlink of DH and computer science.
  The track offers manually compiled gold standard reference alignments for all the test cases, ensuring semantic, lexical and part-of-speech similartiy.
</dd>

<dt><a href="archaeology/index.html">Archaeology multiling</a>  (arch-multiling)</dt>
<dd>The Archaeology multilingual track aims to evaluate if matching systems are capable of finding alingments in archaeological monolingual datasets in different languages and specialist terms.
  The track is based on a test case of the Digital Humanities track.
</dd>
<dt><a href="ce/index.html">Circular Economy</a> (CE)</dt>
  <dd>
    The Circular Economy track is about matching relevant Circular Economy ontologies.
  </dd>


<h3>Instance and schema matching</h3>

<a name="knowledgegraph" />
<dt><a href="knowledgegraph/index.html">Knowledge graph</a></a></dt>
<dd>
The Knowledge Graph Track contains nine isolated knowledge graphs with instance and schema data. 
The goal of the task is to match both the instances and the schema. 
</dd>

<h3>Instance matching (link discovery)</h3>

<a name="spimbench" />
<dt><a href="https://hobbit-project.github.io/OAEI_2025.html">SPIMBENCH</a> (spimbench) </a><a href="https://hobbit-project.github.io/OAEI_2024.html">  <img width="30" border="0" src="hobbit/hobbit.png"/></a></dt>
<dd>
The goal of this track is to determine when two OWL instances describe the same Creative Work.
The datasets are generated and transformed using SPIMBENCH by altering a set of original data through value-based, structure-based, and semantics-aware transformations (simple combination of transformations).
</dd>

<a name="link" />
<dt><a href="https://hobbit-project.github.io/OAEI_2025.html">Link Discovery</a> (link) </a><a href="https://hobbit-project.github.io/OAEI_2024.html">  <img width="30" border="0" src="hobbit/hobbit.png"/></a></dt>
<dd>This track proposes a benchmark generator to deal with link discovery for spatial data where spatial data are
represented as trajectories (i.e., sequences of longitude, latitude pairs).  
</dd>

<dt><a href="pharmacogenomics/index.html">Pharmacogenomics</a> (pgx)</dt>
<dd>The Pharmacogenomics Track involves n-ary tuples representing so-called "pharmacogenomic relationships" and their components of three distinct types: drugs, genetic factors, and phenotypes.
</dd>

    
<!-- <a name="geolink cruise" />
<dt><a href="geolinkcruise/index.html">GeoLink Cruise</a> (geolink cruise) </a></dt>
<dd>
The goal of this track is to determine if two instances from different ontologies describe the same cruise.
The datasets are collected from the Geolink project, which was funded under the U.S. National Science Foundation's EarthCube initiative. The datasets and alignments are guaranteed to contain real-world use cases to solve the instance matching problem in practice. 
</dd>

<h3>Tabular data to Knowledge Graph matching</h3>

<a name="tabular" />
<dt><a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/challenges/sem-tab/">TD&rarr;KG</a> (special track)</dt>
<dd>
Tabular data to Knowledge Graph (KG) matching is the process of assigning semantic tags from Knowledge Graphs 
(e.g., Wikidata or DBpedia) to the elements of a table (e.g., a web table or an arbitrary csv file). 
Ontology alignment and link discovery systems are welcome to participate. 
We plan to create input data in OWL/RDF format to facilitate their participation.
There will be <b>prizes</b> sponsored by <a href="http://sirius-labs.no/" target="blank">SIRIUS</a> and <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/" target="blank">IBM Research</a>.
</dd>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<h3>Preparation phase</h3>

<p>
All public datasets should be available by the end of this phase. 
MELT includes several built-in evaluation tracks: <a href="https://dwslab.github.io/melt/track-repository">built-in datasets</a>.  
</p>

<p><b>New organisers:</b> can perform the evaluation via a <a href="https://dwslab.github.io/melt/matcher-evaluation/local-track">Local Track</a> or contacting the <a href="organization.html">platform chairs</a> to create a new built-in track.</p>

<h3>Execution phase</h3>

<p>
OAEI participants should follow the <a href="melt/index.html">MELT instructions</a> (schema matching tracks) and/or the <a href="https://hobbit-project.github.io/OAEI_2024.html">HOBBIT instructions</a> (spimbench and link discovery tracks) 
depending on the tracks they are willing to participate. The TD&rarr;KG track is an exception as it has its own evaluation process.
</p>

<p>We encourage systems developers to test their systems in the early stages of this phase to avoid last minute 
problems with the evaluation infrastructure. Once the execution phase ends, there will be limited time to solve technical problems 
with the evaluation platforms. 
</p>



<h3>Evaluation phase</h3>

<p> Evaluation will be run under <a href="melt/index.html">MELT</a> 
or <a href="https://hobbit-project.github.io/OAEI_2025.html">HOBBIT</a> infrastructure</a>.
The TD&rarr;KG track is an exception as it has its own evaluation process.
</p>


<p>
Participants will be evaluated with respect to
<b>all of the OAEI tracks</b> (when possible) even though the system 
might be specialized for some specific kind of matching problems.
We know that this can be a problem for some systems that have specifically been developed for, e.g., matching biomedical ontologies; 
but this point can still be emphasized in the specific results paper about the system in case the results generated for some specific 
track are not good at all.
</p>

<p>
The results will be reported at the <a href="http://om.ontologymatching.org/2025">International Workshop on Ontology Matching</a>, 
which will be collocated with the <a href="https://iswc2025.semanticweb.org/">24th International Semantic Web Conference</a> (ISWC 2025).
</p>

<h2>OAEI rules</h2>


<p>
Please note that, a matcher may want to behave differently given what it is 
provided with as ontologies; however, this should not be based on features 
specific of the tracks (e.g., there is a specific string in the URL, or a specific
class name) but on features of the ontologies (e.g., there are no instances or
labels are in German). Check the <a href="../doc/oaei-rules.2.html">OAEI rules here</a>.
</p>


<p>
Systems that rely or are derived from other ontology matching systems should: 
(a) clearly state the system they rely on, and (b) what was changed from / added to the original system.
</p>


<p>
<b>Withdrawal</b> of systems is possible up to one week after submission. After this period you accept that 
your systems will be evaluated and the results will be made publicly available within the OAEI pages and the 
OAEI evaluation report in accordance to the
<a href="../doc/oaei-deontology.2.html">OAEI data policy</a>.
