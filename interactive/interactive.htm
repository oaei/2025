<h2><a name="description"><u>Description</u></a></h2>

<!--<p>Many Ontology Matching systems have been developed over the last years. After several years of experience, the results can only
be slightly improved in terms of the alignment quality (precision/recall resp. F-Measure). Based on this insight, it is clear that
fully automatic ontology matching systems slowly reach an upper bound of the results they can achieve. By incorporating user interaction,
we expect to improve the alignments even further and to push this upper boundary. Semi-automatic ontology matching
approaches are quite promising since humans can really help the systems, for example by detecting incorrect correspondences.</p>-->

<!--<p>Whenever the user is directly involved, all required efforts of the human have taken into account and it has to be in an appropriate proportion to
the result. Thus, beside the quality of the alignment, other measures like the number of interactions are interesting and meaningful

<p>The growth of the ontology alignment area in the past ten years has led to the development of many ontology alignment tools.
After several years of experience in the OAEI, we observed that the results can only be slightly improved in terms of the
alignment quality (precision/recall resp. F-Measure). Based on this insight, it is clear that fully automatic ontology matching
approaches slowly reach an upper bound of the alignment quality they can achieve. A work by <a href="#references">(Jimenez-Ruiz et al., 2012)</a> has shown
that simulating user interactions with 30% error rate during the alignment process has led to the same results as non-interactive matching.
Thus, in addition to the validation of the automatically generated alignments by domain experts, we believe that there is
further room for improving the quality of the generated alignments by incorporating user interaction. User involvement during
the matching process has been identified as one of the challenges in front of the ontology alignment community by <a href="#references">(Shvaiko et al., 2013)</a>
and user interaction with a system is an integral part of it.</p>

<p>At the same time with the tendency of increasing ontology sizes, the alignment problem also grows.
It is not feasible for a user to, for instance validate all candidate mappings generated by a system, i.e.,
tool developers should aim at reducing unnecessary user interventions. All required efforts of the human have
to be taken into account and it has to be in an appropriate proportion to the result.
Thus, beside the quality of the alignment, other measures like the number of interactions are interesting and meaningful
to decide which matching system is best suitable for a certain matching task. By now, all OAEI tracks focus on
fully automatic matching and semi-automatic matching is not evaluated although such systems already exist, e.g.,
overview in <a href="#references">(Ivanova et al., 2015)</a>. As long as the evaluation of such systems is not driven forward,
it is hardly possible to systematically compare the quality of interactive matching approaches.</p>


 <br/>

<h2><a name="goal"><u>Goal</u></a></h2>


<p>The OAEI's interactive track aims at offering a <b>systematic and automated evaluation of matching systems with user interaction</b> to
compare the quality of interactive matching approaches in terms of F-measure and number of required interactions.
To this end we rely on the datasets of the OAEI 2025 <a href="../conference/">Conference</a> and <a href="../anatomy">Anatomy</a>,
<!--<a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/projects/SEALS/oaei/">Largebio</a>, and <a href="../phenotype/">Phenotype</a> -->
tracks.
We have used the reference alignments of each track as <i>oracles</i> in order
to simulate the interaction with a domain expert (see <a href="#references">(Dragisic et al., 2016)</a> and
<a href="#references">(Paulheim et al., 2013)</a>).</p>


<p>In this track we currently focus on one of the challenges regarding user interaction.
The goal of this track is to show in general that the exploitation of user interaction allows further
improving the results of ontology matching systems in terms of F-measure. We would also like to see which semi-automatic methods exist,
which ones perform best, and which ones need the smallest amount of interactions, i.e., make best use of the scarce resource of users' time.
Beside the amount of user interactions, the type of the interaction and the involvement time is interesting.
Do matching systems involve the user interaction before or during the process? Do they ask the user only to verify single
correspondences or complete alignments? Altogether, we aim to promote the development of semi-automatic
ontology matching systems and methods to overcome the limitations which are caused by fully automatic techniques.
Furthermore, the track will encourage a discussion of different interactive matching techniques as well as a set of relevant interaction primitives.
Currently, this track does not evaluate the user experience or the user interfaces of the systems.</p>

<h2><a name="evaluation"><u>Evaluation</u></a></h2>

<p>
The evaluation of this track will still be run with support of SEALS this year (with the possibility moved to MELT in the future).
This requires that you wrap your matching system in a way that allows us to execute it on the
SEALS platform (see <a href="http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2020/seals/index.html">Tutorial on Tool Wrapping</a>).
Note that in this track we allow systems to interact with the SEALS client to check if a given alignment is correct or not
(see the <a href="https://github.com/DanFaria/OAEI_SealsClient/blob/master/OracleTutorial.pdf">oracle tutorial</a> which describes the
additional methods for the interactive track).
To check whether the matching task allows interactivity, you can call the method <u><i>Oracle.isInteractive()</i></u>.
This method returns a boolean value, TRUE if it is an interactive track and false otherwise.
</p>

<p>
We will also simulate domain experts with variable error rate (see <a href="#references">(Zlatan et al., 2016)</a>)
 which reflects a more realistic scenario where a (simulated) user does
not necessarily provide always a correct answer. In these scenarios asking a large number of questions to the user may also have a negative impact.
The error rates (0..1) that will be simulated are: 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3. This can be controlled as an input parameter when
running the SEALS client, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/DanFaria/OAEI_SealsClient/blob/master/SealsClientTutorial.pdf">OAEI tutorial</a>.
